 1) Run mycharm.inp until the first stop
  
 2) Read coordinates of the QM region 
     from the charmm output 

 3) Prepare define for TURBOMOLE
    in the data directory 

 4) make a single point calculations in data
    (not necessary, but will help convergence of the first QM/MM step)

 5) Add keywords:

$point_charges file=point_charges
$point_charge_gradients file=pc_gradient

and in the "$drvopt" section:
   point charges

 to enable evaluation of forces on MM atoms from QM region

 6) after steps 1-5, 
    continue by removing the "stop"
